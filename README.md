# Portfolio2

I'm Aleksander from Slovenia, and I decided to put my portfolio in progress on github for job hunting. I'm currently working on the udemy's course (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).

The TinDog and the drum kit are from the course which show knowledge from Bootstrap and JS. In TinDog, I've changed the color a bit from solid to gradient and added a back to homepage button. In the DrumKit, I've added a hi-hat sound, since it was missing, and added a back to homepage button. The rock paper scissors game I made for fun to show JS and a bit of Adobe Photoshop. More projects are going to be uploaded.
